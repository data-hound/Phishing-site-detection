Random Forest Classifier - Predictor/classifier used in Problem Statement 1

Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, 
regression and other tasks, that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at 
training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or 
mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Random decision forests correct for 
decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.
The first algorithm for random decision forests was created by Tin Kam Ho using the random 
subspace method,which, in Ho's formulation, is a way to implement the "stochastic discrimination"
approach to classification proposed by Eugene Kleinberg.
An extension of the algorithm was developed by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler, and "Random Forests" 
is their trademark.The extension combines Breiman's "bagging" idea and random selection 
of features, introduced first by Ho and later independently by Amit and Geman in order to 
construct a collection of decision trees with controlled variance.
